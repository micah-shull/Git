        "\n",
        "`git pull` is essentially a combination of two Git commands: `git fetch` and `git merge`. Here's a detailed explanation of each:\n",
        "\n",
        "### `git fetch`\n",
        "\n",
        "**`git fetch`** is used to download commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository. However, it does not merge these changes into your current branch automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose**: To update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository without modifying your working directory or current branch.\n",
        "- **Usage**: You would use `git fetch` when you want to see what others have committed to the remote repository before integrating those changes into your local branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of `git fetch`\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "git fetch origin\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This command fetches all the changes from the remote repository named `origin` and updates the remote-tracking branches. However, your working directory and current branch remain unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `git merge`\n",
        "\n",
        "**`git merge`** is used to combine the changes from one branch into another. After fetching changes from the remote repository, you can merge those changes into your current branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose**: To integrate changes from another branch (or a fetched remote branch) into your current branch.\n",
        "- **Usage**: You would use `git merge` after `git fetch` to incorporate the fetched changes into your current branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of `git merge`\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "git merge origin/main\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This command merges the changes from the remote-tracking branch `origin/main` into your current branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `git pull`\n",
        "\n",
        "**`git pull`** is a shorthand command that performs both `git fetch` and `git merge` in a single step. It fetches changes from the remote repository and then immediately tries to merge those changes into the current branch.\n",

        "- **Purpose**: To update your current branch with the latest changes from the remote repository in one step.\n",
