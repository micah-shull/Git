        "   - Run `git status` to see the list of files with conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   git status\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   You will see output similar to this, showing the unmerged paths:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```plaintext\n",
        "   On branch main\n",
        "   You have unmerged paths.\n",
        "     (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\n",
        "     (use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)\n",
        "\n",
        "   Unmerged paths:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Open the Conflicted Files**:\n",
        "   - Open each conflicted file in your text editor. You will see conflict markers that look like this:\n",
